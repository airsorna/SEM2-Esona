              <strong>What Is Data Visualization?</strong>
              <p>Data visualization has many definitions, but I feel there are only two that are descriptive and encompass the important underlying fact, which is the visual representation of data. The first says, "Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets." (Brush, 2020). The second says, "Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format, and a data visualization tool is the software that generates this presentation. Data visualization provides users with intuitive means to interactively explore and analyze data, enabling them to effectively identify interesting patterns, infer correlations and causalities, and supports sense-making activities." (Li, 2020).</p>
              <p>Looking at these definitions, we see that data visualization is a process of standardizing complex or compound data into more consumable chucks of information for easy comprehension and useability for the user. This involves the conversion of information into graphs, maps, charts, and diagrams with the sole purpose to make identifying patterns, trends, and outliers within the image easier by investigating and evaluating large data sets. In summary, "Data visualization provides a quick and effective way to communicate information in a universal manner using visual information." (Brush, 2020). This is mainly because "Data visualization is one of the steps of the data science process, which states that after data has been collected, processed and modeled, it must be visualized for conclusions to be made. Data visualization is also an element of the broader data presentation architecture (DPA) discipline, which aims to identify, locate, manipulate, format and deliver data in the most efficient way possible." (Brush, 2020). It is for this reason that structuring data using graphs, charts, diagrams, maps, and illustrations is ideal for creating cognition, as we consume data better as images than text. Cognition in this context means the "processes in human beings like perception, attention, learning, memory, thought, concept formation, reading, and problem solving." (STU, 2016). The human brain can identify and distinguish differences in line length, shape, orientation, distances, and color (hue) without requiring extensive processing. This is called human perception, it "refers to the way sensory data is organized, interpreted and consciously experienced. Also, perception can be defined as "the process of recognizing (being aware of), organizing (gathering and storing), and interpreting (binding to knowledge) sensory information" (Li, 2020). </p>
              <p>When quantitative data is presented to the user in a graphical form, the process of "meaning-making" or human perception takes place as the brain detects changes and makes comparisons between quantities, locations, sizes, textures, densities, shapes, orientations, colours, and variations in lightness in order to gain insight.</p>
              <p>Data visualization is made up of two major sub-fields: information visualization and scientific visualization. Information visualization is the presentation of abstract data in a visual format. "Information visualization allows users to draw insights from abstract data in an efficient and effective manner." (Interaction Design Foundation, 2020). Scientific visualization is the presentation of scientific-physical data in a visual format. It involves "displaying complex data in visual form [that] provides a clear and intuitive approach to processing big data analytics and enhances understanding, exploration, and decision-making with the use of familiar, visual metaphors." (Heavy.AI, 2022). Both information visualization and scientific visualization transform raw data into a visual format because "When a user reads or looks at a graphical image, the image is interpreted through the human cognitive system for the acquisition of insight or the apprehension of useful information." (Li, 2020) thereby making it easy to understand and interpret. Therefore, data visualization "plays an important role in making data digestible and turning raw information into actionable insights. It draws from the fields of human-computer interaction, visual design, computer science, and cognitive science, among others." (Interaction Design Foundation, 2020). It functions to make data readily usable and understandable to anyone across the world.</p>
              <strong>The Definition of Data and Information</strong>
              <p>Simply put, data is raw and unprocessed information that has still yet to be given meaning. For example, gold is a raw material that is yet to be processed and made into a necklace, so, in this case, gold represents data. Data can be sorted as names, numbers, symbols, and reports, just to name a few. There are two types of data: primary data and secondary data. Primary data is the data collected from units or individual respondents directly with the intention of fulfilling a certain study of information and Secondary data, on the other hand, is data collected from another set of data. I.e., data collected from a survey report is secondary data. Basically, "primary data can be considered as raw data and the secondary data can be considered as information." (Li, 2020). Moreover, "Data and information have a very close relationship as data is usually defined as ‘unprocessed information’ and information considered ‘processed data’" (Li, 2020). Until data has been processed into information for human consumption, it has no value or significance other than just being a raw material like gold.</p>
              <strong>The Forms of Traditional Data Visualization</strong>
              <p>In this section, the author lists the main forms of traditional data visualization, I’ll quickly run down all of them. Note here that each form of data visualization follows the information design structure, which "aims to design the efficient communication of information as its foremost task, which requests the content needs accurate and unbiased in the visual presentation. It attempts to present all the objective data required to enable the users to make some kind of decision" (Li, 2020). to ensure the user understands the information displayed to him.</p>
              <strong>Trees</strong>
              <p>“Trees are considered one of the earliest visual illustrations of human thought systems” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Maps</strong>
              <p>“A map is considered as a graphical depiction highlighting relationships between elements of space (objects or regions)” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Scatter Plots</strong>
              <p>“A scatter plot is considered as one of the earliest and most widely used data visualizations, which is based on the Cartesian coordinate system” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Charts</strong>
              <p>“Charts are the useful forms to represent data in line, bar, or slice forms.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Tables</strong>
              <p>“A table is one of the most common forms to display data within many fields. The data table can be an efficient form to comparative data on categorical objects. It usually uses rows and columns to represent data in two dimensions in the meaningful way. The quantitative data are placed in the square sited at the intersection of the row and column (named Table cells).” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Diagram</strong>
              <p>“A diagram can be used in business-system analysis that consists of rectangles and lines illustrating information flow.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Graphs</strong>
              <p>“A graph is similar to a diagram. In fact, the terms graph, diagram and chart are similar and can overlap. Graphics may have many purposes for presenting data. For example, a graph can help people to perceive and recognize the broad features of the data or information.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Waveform</strong>
              <p>“Waveform is a common form that is used in visual representation of the form of a signal, which refers to the shape of the time related to various quantities of data.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Simulation</strong>
              <p>“Simulation is one of most useful forms of scientific visualization. One of the important advantages of simulation is that it enables viewers to understand and describe natural phenomena such as weather changes or the role of dark energy in the universe” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <strong>Volume</strong>
              <p>“Volume data set are multidimensional arrays of scalar data and vector data, which are typically defined on lattice structures representing values sampled in 3D environment” (Li, 2020)</p>

                <strong>Reflection</strong>
                <p>Taking into account that this is a prototype, I have designed this with the mindset that more will be added as time goes on. However, I have implemented some exciting functions and features on this website. Starting with the homepage, the "Welcome" text greets the user with an animation that fades in at the centre of the web page. To see it again, you must refresh the page. This is a nice feature I hope to build on and probably make each letter do its own little animation.</p>
                <p>As for navigation, I’ve implemented a black circular background on the active page to make the user aware of what page they are currently reading. The effectiveness of this compliments the other web page buttons, i.e., when you are trying to move from "Blog" to "Data-Art", there is a visual indicator that shows you have successfully left the "Blog" and you are currently on "Data-Art" with the help of the black circular background.</p>
                <p>I have made the web page buttons responsive when the user hovers over them. The color of the text changes from white to orange and the letters space out. Basically, there is a change in colour and position of the text to communicate to the user that this is clickable by grabbing the user’s attention.</p>
                <p>Finally, color choice is driven by the background. As you can see, my background is blue-ish in colour, so keeping with the theme, I chose colours that aren’t far from that aesthetic. With the orange colors incorporated, i.e., welcome and web page text, the aim with those was to make them stand out and, again, fit the color theme aesthetic I was using. Orange happened to be that color.</p>
